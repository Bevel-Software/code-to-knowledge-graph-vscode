The **Bevel LSP Interface** is a VS Code extension that acts as a vital bridge between your integrated development environment and the powerful [Code-to-Knowledge-Graph Java library](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/code-to-knowledge-graph). It starts a local HTTP server, allowing the Code-to-Knowledge-Graph library (or other external tools) to securely query your codebase for symbols, references, definitions, and other structural information by leveraging VS Code's built-in Language Server Protocol capabilities.

This extension is can be used in tandem with the Code-to-Knowledge-Graph library to do the following on your own code:
*   üîç **Extract deep structural information** from your code.
*   üó£Ô∏è **Communicate code insights** to external analysis tools.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Power advanced code understanding** and knowledge graph generation.

Essentially, this extension turns VS Code into a data source for sophisticated code analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **HTTP Interface:** Exposes VS Code's LSP commands over a local HTTP REST API.
*   **Dynamic Port Allocation:** Automatically finds an available port and writes it to `.bevel/do_not_share/port` for discovery by client applications like the Code-to-Knowledge-Graph library.
*   **Robust Command Execution:** Handles various VS Code commands such as:
    *   `vscode.executeReferenceProvider` (Find all references)
    *   `vscode.executeDefinitionProvider` (Go to definition)
    *   `vscode.executeWorkspaceSymbolProvider` (Search symbols in workspace)
    *   `vscode.executeDocumentSymbolProvider` (Get symbols in a document)
*   **Batch Processing:** Supports batching of commands for improved performance when dealing with multiple requests.
*   **Standardized Data Transfer:** Uses clear JSON structures (`src/data/*.ts`) for requests and responses.
*   **Automatic Activation:** Starts automatically when VS Code finishes loading (`onStartupFinished`).
*   **Singleton Server:** Checks if a server instance is already running on the configured port to prevent multiple instances.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Activation:** When VS Code starts and your project is loaded, this extension activates.
2.  **Server Startup:**
    *   It first checks if a port is specified in the project's `.bevel/do_not_share/port` file.
    *   If a port is found, it pings `http://localhost:<port>/api/isAlive` to see if an instance of this server is already running.
    *   If no server is running (or no port file exists), it starts a new Express.js HTTP server on a dynamically assigned available port.
    *   The chosen port number is then written to `.bevel/do_not_share/port` within your project's workspace. This allows client applications (like the Code-to-Knowledge-Graph Java library) to discover which port to communicate on.
3.  **API Endpoints:** The server listens for incoming HTTP requests on specific endpoints (e.g., `/api/command`).
4.  **Command Execution:**
    *   When a request is received (typically from the Code-to-Knowledge-Graph Java library), the extension translates it into a corresponding `vscode.commands.executeCommand(...)` call.
    *   It leverages VS Code's internal LSP capabilities to fetch the requested code information (e.g., symbol locations, references).
5.  **Response:** The results from VS Code are packaged into a JSON response and sent back to the client.

This extension acts as an intermediary, making VS Code's powerful code intelligence accessible to external processes.

## üì¶ Installation

1.  Open **VS Code**.
2.  Go to the **Extensions** view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).
3.  Search for `Bevel LSP Interface` or `bevel-software.code-to-knowledge-graph-vscode`.
4.  Click **Install**.

The extension will be automatically activated when VS Code starts.

## üöÄ Usage

This extension primarily works in the background. Its main purpose is to serve requests from the [Code-to-Knowledge-Graph Java library](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/code-to-knowledge-graph).

1.  Ensure this extension is installed and enabled in VS Code.
2.  Open the project you want to analyze in VS Code.
3.  When you run the Code-to-Knowledge-Graph Java library (or a similar tool configured to use this extension), it will:
    *   Read the port number from the `.bevel/do_not_share/port` file in your project's root.
    *   Send HTTP requests to this extension at `http://localhost:<port>/api/...`.
4.  The extension will process these requests and return code information.

**Key File:**
*   `.bevel/do_not_share/port`: This file is automatically created/updated by the extension in your project's root directory. It contains the port number the internal HTTP server is listening on. Client applications should read this file to know where to connect.

## üîß Configuration

The extension is designed to be zero-config for most use cases. The port for the HTTP server is allocated dynamically.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers of This Extension

If you want to contribute to or modify the Bevel LSP Interface extension itself:

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version specified in `package.json` `engines.node` or newer, e.g., 20.x)
*   NPM (comes with Node.js)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/code-to-knowledge-graph-vscode.git # Or your fork
    cd code-to-knowledge-graph-vscode
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Development Workflow

*   **Watch for changes and auto-recompile:**
    ```bash
    npm run watch
    ```
    This command runs `esbuild` in watch mode to recompile TypeScript files and `tsc` for type-checking in watch mode.
*   **Run in VS Code Debug Mode:**
    *   Open the project in VS Code.
    *   Press `F5` to open a new VS Code window (Extension Development Host) with the extension loaded.
    *   You can set breakpoints in your `.ts` files and debug the extension.
    *   Output from `console.log` in the extension will appear in the Debug Console of the main VS Code window (where you pressed F5).
*   **Linting:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
*   **Type Checking:**
    ```bash
    npm run check-types
    ```
*   **Building for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run package
    # or
    npm run build
    ```
    This creates a production-ready build in the `out/` directory.
*   **Running Tests:**
    Tests use `@vscode/test-cli`.
    ```bash
    npm run pretest # This compiles tests and builds the extension
    # To run tests (after pretest):
    # npx vscode-test # This usually requires configuration in .vscode-test.mjs
    # Alternatively, use the VS Code Testing view if configured.
    ```
    (Test setup is defined in `.vscode-test.mjs` and tests are typically in `out/test/**/*.test.js` after compilation from `src/test/`.)
